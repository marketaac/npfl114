section: Notation
# Notation

- $a$, $‚Üía$, $‚áâA$, $‚á∂A$: scalar (integer or real), vector, matrix, tensor

- $‚Åáa$, $‚Åá‚Üía$, $‚Åá‚áâA$: scalar, vector, matrix random variable

~~~
- $\frac{df}{dx}$: derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$

- $\frac{‚àÇf}{‚àÇx}$: partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$

~~~
- $‚àá_‚Üíx f$: gradient of $f$ with respect to $‚Üíx$, i.e.,
  $\left(\frac{‚àÇf(‚Üíx)}{‚àÇx_1}, \frac{‚àÇf(‚Üíx)}{‚àÇx_2}, \ldots, \frac{‚àÇf(‚Üíx)}{‚àÇx_n}\right)$

---
section: Random Variables
# Random Variables
A random variable $‚Åáx$ is a result of a random process. It can be discrete or
continuous.

~~~
## Probability Distribution
A probability distribution describes how likely are individual values a random
variable can take.

The notation $‚Åáx ‚àº P$ stands for a random variable $‚Åáx$ having a distribution $P$.

~~~
For discrete variables, the probability that $‚Åáx$ takes a value $x$ is denoted as
$P(x)$ or explicitly as $P(‚Åáx = x)$.

~~~
For continuous variables, the probability that the value of $‚Åáx$ lies in the interval
$[a, b]$ is given by $‚à´_a^b p(x)\d x$.

---
# Random Variables

## Expectation
The expectation of a function $f(x)$ with respect to discrete probability
distribution $P(x)$ is defined as:
$$ùîº_{‚Åáx ‚àº P}[f(x)] ‚âù ‚àë_x P(x)f(x)$$

For continuous variables it is computed as:
$$ùîº_{‚Åáx ‚àº p}[f(x)] ‚âù ‚à´_x p(x)f(x)\d x$$

~~~
If the random variable is obvious from context, we can write only $ùîº_P[x]$
of even $ùîº[x]$.

~~~
Expectation is linear, i.e.,
$$ùîº_‚Åáx [Œ±f(x) + Œ≤g(x)] = Œ±ùîº_‚Åáx [f(x)] + Œ≤ùîº_‚Åáx [g(x)]$$

---
# Random Variables

## Variance
Variance measures how much the values of a random variable differ from its
mean $Œº = ùîº[x]$.

$$\begin{aligned}
  \Var(x) &‚âù ùîº\left[\big(x - ùîº[x]\big)^2\right]\textrm{, or more generally} \\
  \Var(f(x)) &‚âù ùîº\left[\big(f(x) - ùîº[f(x)]\big)^2\right]
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
It is easy to see that
$$\Var(x) = ùîº\left[x^2 - 2xùîº[x] + \big(ùîº[x]\big)^2\right] = ùîº\left[x^2\right] - \big(ùîº[x]\big)^2.$$

~~~
Variance is connected to $E[x^2]$, a _second moment_ of a random
variable ‚Äì it is in fact a _centered_ second moment.

---
# Common Probability Distributions
## Bernoulli Distribution
The Bernoulli distribution is a distribution over a binary random variable.
It has a single parameter $œÜ ‚àà [0, 1]$, which specifies the probability of the random
variable being equal to 1.

~~~
$$\begin{aligned}
  P(x) &= œÜ^x (1-œÜ)^{1-x} \\
  ùîº[x] &= œÜ \\
  \Var(x) &= œÜ(1-œÜ)
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
## Categorical Distribution
Extension of the Bernoulli distribution to random variables taking one of $k$ different
discrete outcomes. It is parametrized by $‚Üíp ‚àà [0, 1]^k$ such that $‚àë_{i=1}^{k} p_{i} = 1$.
$$\begin{aligned}
  P(‚Üíx) &= ‚àè\nolimits_i^k p_i^{x_i} \\
  ùîº[x_i] &= p_i, \Var(x_i) = p_i(1-p_i) \\
\end{aligned}$$

section: Information Theory
# Information Theory

## Self Information

Amount of _surprise_ when a random variable is sampled.
~~~
- Should be zero for events with probability 1.
~~~
- Less likely events are more surprising.
~~~
- Independent events should have _additive_ information.

~~~
$$I(x) ‚âù -\log P(x) = \log \frac{1}{P(x)}$$

~~~
## Entropy

Amount of _surprise_ in the whole distribution.
$$H(P) ‚âù ùîº_{‚Åáx‚àºP}[I(x)] = -ùîº_{‚Åáx‚àºP}[\log P(x)]$$

~~~
- for discrete $P$: $H(P) = -‚àë_x P(x) \log P(x)$
- for continuous $P$: $H(P) = -‚à´ P(x) \log P(x)\,\mathrm dx$

---
# Information Theory

## Cross-Entropy

$$H(P, Q) ‚âù -ùîº_{‚Åáx‚àºP}[\log Q(x)]$$

~~~
- Gibbs inequality
    - $H(P, Q) ‚â• H(P)$
    - $H(P) = H(P, Q) ‚áî P = Q$
~~~
    - Proof: Using Jensen's inequality, we get
      $$‚àë_x P(x) \log \frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} ‚â§ \log ‚àë_x P(x) \frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} = \log ‚àë_x Q(x) = 0.$$
~~~
    - Corollary: For a categorical distribution with $n$ outcomes, $H(P) ‚â§ \log n$,
    because for $Q(x) = 1/n$ we get $H(P) ‚â§ H(P, Q) = -‚àë_x P(x) \log Q(x) = \log n.$
~~~
- generally $H(P, Q) ‚â† H(Q, P)$

---
# Information Theory

## Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence)

Sometimes also called _relative entropy_.

$$D_\textrm{KL}(P || Q) ‚âù H(P, Q) - H(P) = ùîº_{‚Åáx‚àºP}[\log P(x) - \log Q(x)]$$

~~~
- consequence of Gibbs inequality: $D_\textrm{KL}(P || Q) ‚â• 0$
- generally $D_\textrm{KL}(P || Q) ‚â† D_\textrm{KL}(Q || P)$

---
# Nonsymmetry of KL Divergence

![w=100%,v=middle](kl_nonsymmetry.pdf)

---
# Common Probability Distributions
## Normal (or Gaussian) Distribution
Distribution over real numbers, parametrized by a mean $Œº$ and variance $œÉ^2$:
$$ùìù(x; Œº, œÉ^2) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2œÄœÉ^2}} \exp \left(-\frac{(x - Œº)^2}{2œÉ^2}\right)$$

For standard values $Œº=0$ and $œÉ^2=1$ we get $ùìù(x; 0, 1) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2œÄ}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$.

![w=45%,h=center](normal_distribution.pdf)

# Why Normal Distribution

## Central Limit Theorem
The sum of independent identically distributed random variables
with finite variance converges to normal distribution.

~~~
## Principle of Maximum Entropy
Given a set of constraints, a distribution with maximal entropy fulfilling the
constraints can be considered the most general one, containing as little
additional assumptions as possible.

~~~
Considering distributions with a given mean and variance, it can be proven
(using variational inference) that such a distribution with _maximal entropy_
is exactly the normal distribution.

# Machine Learning

A possible definition of learning from Mitchell (1997):
>  A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some
>  class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in
>  T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

~~~
- Task T
    - _classification_: assigning one of $k$ categories to a given input
    - _regression_: producing a number $x‚àà‚Ñù$ for a given input
    - _structured prediction_, _denoising_, _density estimation_, ‚Ä¶
- Experience E
    - _supervised_: usually a dataset with desired outcomes (_labels_ or
      _targets_)
    - _unsupervised_: usually data without any annotation (raw text, raw images, ‚Ä¶)
    - _reinforcement learning_, _semi-supervised learning_, ‚Ä¶
- Measure P
    - _accuracy_, _error rate_, _F-score_, ‚Ä¶

# Neural Network Architecture

There is a weight on each edge, and an activation function $f$ is performed on the
hidden layers, and optionally also on the output layer.
$$h_i = f\left(‚àë_j w_{i,j} x_j\right)$$

If the network is composed of layers, we can use matrix notation and write:
$$‚Üíh = f\left(‚áâW ‚Üíx\right)$$

---
# Neural Network Activation Functions
## Output Layers
- none (linear regression if there are no hidden layers)

~~~
- $œÉ$ (sigmoid; logistic regression if there are no hidden layers)
  $$œÉ(x) ‚âù \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$

~~~
- $\softmax$ (maximum entropy model if there are no hidden layers)
  $$\softmax(‚Üíx) ‚àù e^‚Üíx$$
  $$\softmax(‚Üíx)_i ‚âù \frac{e^{x_i}}{‚àë_j e^{x_j}}$$

---
# Neural Network Activation Functions
## Hidden Layers
- none (does not help, composition of linear mapping is a linear mapping)

~~~
- $œÉ$ (but works badly ‚Äì nonsymmetrical, $\frac{dœÉ}{dx}(0) = 1/4$)

~~~
- $\tanh$
    - result of making $œÉ$ symmetrical and making derivation in zero 1
    - $\tanh(x) = 2œÉ(2x) - 1$

# Universal Approximation Theorem '89


Let $œÜ(x)$ be a nonconstant, bounded and nondecreasing continuous function.
<br>(Later a proof was given also for $œÜ = \ReLU$.)

Then for any $Œµ > 0$ and any continuous function $f$ on $[0, 1]^m$ there exists
an $N ‚àà ‚Ñï, v_i ‚àà ‚Ñù, b_i ‚àà ‚Ñù$ and $‚Üí{w_i} ‚àà ‚Ñù^m$, such that if we denote
$$F(‚Üíx) = ‚àë_{i=1}^N v_i œÜ(‚Üí{w_i} \cdot ‚Üíx + b_i)$$
then for all $x ‚àà [0, 1]^m$
$$|F(‚Üíx) - f(‚Üíx)| < Œµ.$$

# Universal Approximation Theorem for ReLUs

Sketch of the proof:

~~~
- If a function is continuous on a closed interval, it can be approximated by
  a sequence of lines to arbitrary precision.

![w=35%,h=center](relu_approx.svg)

~~~
- However, we can create a sequence of $k$ linear segments as a sum of $k$ ReLU
  units ‚Äì on every endpoint a new ReLU starts (i.e., the input ReLU value is
  zero at the endpoint), with a tangent which is the difference between the
  target tanget and the tangent of the approximation until this point.

# Universal Approximation Theorem for Squashes

Sketch of the proof for a squashing function $œÜ(x)$ (i.e., nonconstant, bounded and
nondecreasing continuous function like sigmoid):

~~~
- We can prove $œÜ$ can be arbitrarily close to a hard threshold by compressing
  it horizontally.

![w=38%,h=center](universal_approximation_squash.png)

~~~
- Then we approximate the original function using a series of straight line
  segments
